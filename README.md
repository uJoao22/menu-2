# Menu bar
Code developed in C# Windows Form application mode. The program aims to bring up the menu bar by calling another form, clicking on "Chamar Fromulario", after clicking FrmSecundario starts running, showing the current time and giving you the option to select a photo. When you click on "Sair" a confirmation message to sign out appears.

The main file is <b><i>MainForm.cs</i></b>, which gives access to the other files via the menu bar.

Here is a gif of how the application works:
